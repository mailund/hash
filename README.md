# Various hash tables in C

This repository contains various implementations of hash tables for sets and maps. Each implementation consists of one header and one implementation file, so they are lightweight to add to your own projects.

To use the tables, just add the source files to your project. All the set implementations have the same name and so do all the map implementations, so you might have to change the names if you need more than one of these.

To cite these implementations, please use [*The Joys of Hashing*](https://amzn.to/2pngZQ0).
